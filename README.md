# Paper-Valence-and-Arousal-Prediction-
This paper proposes a random forest classifier to predict a personâ€™s emotional state, that is, the level of valence and arousal. The underlying data combines features extracted from sensing modalities such as electrocardiograms (ECG), electroencephalograms (EEG), electrodermal activities (EDA) and facial landmark trajectories (EMO). The ASCERTAIN dataset was used that collected data from 44 participants watching different affective movie clips. In a first step, the data was pre-processed and meaningful features were extracted. In a second step, a RF classifier was implemented and tested that predicts the emotional state (arousal and valence) of a participant using two different cross-validation approaches. Additionally, an evaluation of the most important features for each model was performed.
